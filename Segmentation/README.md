## Change detection and foreground/background segmentation

This folder contains the evaluation code and scripts for evaluating classical change detection, or foreground/background segmentation algorithms. 

Folder guide:

* **cdNet:** Contains evaluation code from the changedetection.net project. The code compares the output images of change detection algorithms and compares it to the ground truth images. When using this with the AAU RainSnow annotations, use the available ground truth masks in the 'rgbMasks' folder of each sequence. The heavy lifting of comparing the binary masks is done in C++ whereas the computation metrics (FP, FN, etc.) is done with python scripts
* **evaluateObjectSize**: Computes statistics of the annotated objects
* **evaluateProcessingSpeed**: Computes statistics of the processing speed of the rain removal algorithms. Takes point of departure in the creation time of the de-rained images. 
* **statAggregator**: Aggregates the statistics generated by the scripts in the cdNet folder and outputs summarized csv-files and LaTeX tables.
